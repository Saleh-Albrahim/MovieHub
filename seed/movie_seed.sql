		'The film takes place in the near future, with Earth in the grip of The Blight, an airborne disease that causes food crops to turn to grey-brown powder. It rolls and billows across the land, piling up around houses and cars like the dust-drifts in Andrei Tarkovsky’s Stalker, another film in which the characters slip between time’s cogs.',
		'He’s the preeminent blockbuster auteur of our time, a fiercely rational puzzle-maker and problem-solver; the Mies van der Rohe of Hollywood. He prefers shooting on film to digital cameras, and strives to achieve special effects on set rather than at a computer-graphics workstation. The rotating hotel corridor scene in Inception – a fist-fight in which the combatants spin and click together like the workings of a combination lock – is Nolan’s vision of cinema in miniature. Depending on which critic you talk to, he’s either a throwback, a fusspot and an ideologue, or the spiritual offspring of Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick. (Of course, there’s no reason he can’t be all of the above.)

	(2, 'The Cabin in the Woods', 7.7, '1h49m', 'Horror', 2, 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/NsIilFNNmkY',
		'The Cabin in the Woods begins by unveiling two sets of characters: one middle-aged and oppressed by the workaday cares of life, the other young and carefree. Richard Jenkins plays Sitterson, a balding, bespectacled guy who resignedly shoots the breeze with his buddy Hadley, played by Bradley Whitford. Then we cut to a suburban home, and a teenage girls bedroom – both disclosed via a soaring crane shot. This is Dana, played by Kristen Connolly, and genre buffs will smirk at the outrageous way we get to see Dana sauntering around in her underwear, packing for a restorative weekend away with her attractive friends at a cabin in the woods',
		'Dana is getting over a borderline-inappropriate relationship with her college professor. Her raunchy blonde friend Jules (Anna Hutchison) and Jules macho jock boyfriend Curt (Chris Hemsworth) are trying to set her up with a cute guy they are bringing along, Holden (Jesse Williams). And just to complete the party, there is Marty (Fran Kranz), a dope-smoking free-thinker, forever railing against the establishment. The five of them turn up to the very creepy cabin after the regulation encounter with the dodgy local. Again, the film is archly aware of how predictable this character is, and overtly tips us a wink by repeatedly showing us the motorbike attached to the back of the camper van the five are travelling in. Could it be that this bike will feature heavily in a final getaway scene?', 'July 16, 2019');

	(3, 'The Godfather', 9.7, '2h 55min', 'Crime Drama ', 3, 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/sY1S34973zA',
		'Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a "godfather" or "don," the head of a Mafia family.',
		'Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family "business." A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael''s life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie''s husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family''s power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi', 'March 14, 1972');
